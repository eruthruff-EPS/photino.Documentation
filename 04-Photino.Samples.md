# Photino.Samples

## Audience
This document is for .NET developers who would like to get started building Photino projects in .NET or Blazor and for those who would like to contribute to the samples repository.

## Overview
These samples represent a wide range of starter projects that highlight the use of various web UI frameworks and Photino capabilities on the .NET platform.

The Visual Stuido solution source code can be found in the [GitHub repository]("https://github.com/tryphotino/photino.Samples")

## Usage Instructions 
If you just want to use the samples projects (not become a contributor), we recommend installing the project templates for Visual Studio and/or dotnet CLI (with or without VS Code). The templates will create the sample projects authored here.

## Building
Use standard Visual Studio build procedures for Visual Studio. If you're using the dotnet CLI (with or without VS CODE), use the standard `dotnet restore`, `dotnet build`, and `dotnet run` commands.
